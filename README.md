# flutter_app_1

This is a Flutter Project following the CodeLab from Google: Your First Flutter Project.
This project was ran using an Android Emulator from Android Studio.

In this project, I learned how to create different widgets (both stateless and stateful), different pages, and learn the basic keywords that are a part of Dart.

Reflection:
This project was very helpful in learning different Flutter methods!

A new Flutter project.
